# Final Project Questions - Example

## Project Structure and Organization

1. How does modularizing code from Jupyter notebooks into proper Python modules improve maintainability and collaboration in ML projects?

2. How does implementing a `ModelPredictor` class improve the deployment capabilities of a machine learning model?

3. Explain the concept of separation of concerns in ML project development. How is it implemented in the project structure you've learned about?

## Data and Model Versioning with DVC

4. Explain how DVC tracks large data files without storing them directly in Git repositories.

5. How can DVC help with reproducing a specific machine learning experiment from the past?

6. What problem does Data Version Control (DVC) solve in machine learning workflows that Git alone cannot address?

## Experiment Tracking with MLflow

7. Describe a strategy for transitioning models from development to staging to production using MLflow's model registry.

8. How does MLflow help address the challenge of reproducing ML experiments?

## API Development with Flask

9. Explain the purpose of creating different API versions (e.g., `/v1/predict` and `/v2/predict`) when deploying ML models.

10. How would you implement a health check endpoint, and why is it important for production ML systems?

## ML Model Deployment Strategies

11. What factors should be considered when choosing between edge deployment and cloud deployment for ML models?

12. Explain the concept of hybrid deployment for ML models and how it combines batch and real-time processing advantages.

## Docker Containerization

13. What security considerations should be addressed when containerizing ML applications?

14. Explain the key components of a Dockerfile for an ML application. What considerations are specific to ML deployments?

## CI/CD Pipelines for ML Projects

15. How do CI/CD pipelines for ML projects differ from traditional software CI/CD pipelines?

16. What strategies can be implemented to ensure data validation checks are included in CI/CD pipelines for ML projects?

## Explainable AI and Model Monitoring

17. Explain the ethical considerations in developing explainable AI solutions.

18. Compare and contrast SHAP and LIME for model explanations. What are the strengths and limitations of each approach?

19. How can model explanations help identify potential biases in machine learning models?
